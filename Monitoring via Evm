1- how much is it over/under budget?
AC=600+1200+400*50%+1200*33.3%=2399.6
Budget=600+1400+200+500=2700
The answer is: over budget by 300.4 k$

2-By how many days is it ahead/behind the schedule?
the total duration=11 months
7 months have passed: at this stage task 2 should be finished and 66.6% of task 4
The answer is: The schedule is behind by one day

3- By the end of the project by how much will it be over/under budget?
According to the current data it is predicted to be over budget by 500 k$

4- Calculate CV SV CPI SPI EAC
Cost Variance: CV = EV-AC EV = Earned Value AC = Actual Cost
0-2399.6= -2399.6
Schedule Variance: SV = EV-PV EV = Earned Value PV = Planned Value
0-2700= -2700
Cost Performance Index CPI = EV/AC EV = Earned Value AC = Actual Cost
0/2399.6= 0
Schedule Performance Index SPI = EV/PV EV = Earned Value PV = Planned Value
0/2700= 0
Estimate At Completion EAC = AC+ETC AC = Actual Cost ETC = Estimate to Completion
2399.6+800.4= 3200
